My project created an Instagram-like way to view New York Times bestsellers. In the feed, you can click on books that you’re interested in and add them to the Reading List. In the Reading List, you can click on books to be taken to the same detail page and you can delete any books that you’re not interested in anymore. In both the Feed and Reading List, you can search for the title, author, or genre of the book. 
My main goal was to create an easy and user-friendly way to browse through New York Times bestsellers.
